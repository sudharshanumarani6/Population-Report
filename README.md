Population Analysis Report 
        Designed and implemented a three-page interactive Power BI dashboard for the India Population Census 2011.
Key Features :
•	Established key metrics including Total Population, Male/Female distribution, and Literacy Rate to provide a comprehensive demographic overview.
•	Developed a choropleth map to visualize Population Density across India, enabling quick identification of High, Medium, and Low-density regions.
•	Performed deep-dive analysis on Union Territories (e.g., Chandigarh) to show granular data on urban/rural splits, sex ratio, and decadal growth.
•	Created regional educational profiles by visualizing "Educated people by Region" (North, South, East, West, Central) for strategic planning purposes.
